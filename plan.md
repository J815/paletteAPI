Project Description:

You are creating a web API to manage and share color palettes. Users can browse public color palettes without logging in, log in to their accounts, create color palettes, publish them publicly or make them private, and save other users' palettes to their favorites. The project uses Django as the backend framework and Django Rest Framework (DRF) to build the API. The API will be accessed through a simple HTML frontend.

Implementation Plan:

     Setup and Configuration:

        Install Django and Django Rest Framework.
        Create a new Django project and a new app within it.
     Define Models:

        Create models for ColorPalette and UserFavorite in the palettes/models.py file.
        Define fields like name, dominant_colors, accent_colors, is_public, and user in the models.
    Create Serializers:

        Implement serializers for the models to convert data to and from JSON format.
        Use ColorPaletteSerializer serializers.py.
Create Views:

       Create views using function-based views to handle various operations.
       Implement the color_palette_list_create view for listing and creating color palettes.
       Create the add_to_favorites view to handle adding palettes to favorites.
Define URLs:

    Configure URLs in palette/urls.py for various views.
     Include the Django admin URLs for admin access.
    Create a URL for the custom authentication status view.
 Create HTML Interface:

    Create index.html for displaying color palettes and login button.
    Load palettes based on user's authentication status.
    Display the "Add to Favorite" button only for logged-in users.

Afterthoughts:
 can't implement properly
 didn't add css
 can't implement authentication properly
 can't add documentation properly
